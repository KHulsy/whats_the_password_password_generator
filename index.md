## Password Generator: Read-Me



### Abstract
I am confident that this assignment is decades ahead of my previous password generator. Having a functioning password generator is always exciting. This is nowhere near as pretty as the Purple Rain theme, but this one works. I incorporated a combo of creative and professional, with a creepy-fun theme of an escaped droid incorporated into the Password Generator. Initially, I created my own index.html and index.js before realizing that there were files in the homework dev folder. I did an npm install of a password generator, which wasn't particularly helful. I finally Google Fu'd and went to the W3's. Now, here's the exciting part: I was able to code out a special character requirement. I looked at the code of warriors, and I got better. It was fabulous.
